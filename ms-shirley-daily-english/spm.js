const sampleAnswers = {
  "Sleeping habit": "I would like to talk about my sleeping habit. I usually go to bed at about eleven o'clock after preparing my schoolbag. I can improve this habit by putting my phone away earlier. A good sleeping habit is important because it helps me stay healthy and focus better in class.",
  "A meaningful holiday": "I would like to talk about a meaningful holiday in Penang with my family. We visited historical places, tried local food and took many photos together. The holiday was meaningful because we spent quality time together. It also taught me to appreciate Malaysia's culture.",
  "Studies after SPM": "In my opinion, teenagers should further their studies after SPM. One reason is that they can gain useful knowledge and skills for their future careers. For example, a student who is interested in technology can study computer science. Therefore, further education can give teenagers more opportunities in life.",
  "Favourite family activity": "My favourite family activity is having dinner together. We usually do this at weekends when everyone is free. I enjoy it because we can share stories and laugh together. Spending time with family is important because it makes our relationship stronger.",
  "Your biggest fear": "My biggest fear is speaking in front of a large crowd. I feel nervous because I worry about making mistakes. To overcome it, I practise in front of my friends and prepare simple notes. I believe facing our fears is important because it helps us become more confident.",
  "Environment": "Protecting the environment is important for the future generation. Firstly, clean air and water are necessary for good health. For example, reducing plastic waste can keep rivers and oceans clean. Teenagers can help by using reusable bottles and separating rubbish for recycling.",
  "An expensive item": "I would like to talk about my laptop, which I bought at a shopping centre. It was expensive, but I use it for homework, research and online learning. It saves time and helps me complete schoolwork more effectively. I think an expensive item is a good choice when it is useful and can last for a long time.",
  "My favourite exercise": "My favourite exercise is badminton. I play it twice a week with my friends at a nearby court. I choose badminton because it is fun and does not require a large team. It improves my fitness, reduces stress and teaches me teamwork.",
  "Crime rate": "A high crime rate can affect a country in several ways. People may feel unsafe, while tourists may avoid visiting the country. For example, businesses may lose customers when an area has many theft cases. Therefore, the government and community must work together to prevent crime.",
  "Favourite colour": "My favourite colour is blue. I have a blue schoolbag, water bottle and several blue shirts. I like it because it makes me feel calm and comfortable. In my opinion, colours can affect our mood because bright colours can make us feel more cheerful.",
  "A shop you like": "A shop I like is a bookstore near my home. I usually buy novels, stationery and revision books there once or twice a month. I enjoy visiting it because the environment is quiet and the staff are helpful. I would join its membership programme to enjoy discounts and collect points.",
  "Eco-friendly practices": "Adopting eco-friendly practices helps to protect the environment. For example, recycling reduces waste, while switching off unused lights saves energy. These actions also protect natural resources and build responsible habits. If many people do small things every day, the overall impact can be great.",
  "Mental health": "Stress is a common mental health problem among teenagers. It may make them tired, worried and unable to focus on their studies. Teenagers can talk to a trusted adult, exercise or take short breaks to manage it. Mental health is important because it affects both our happiness and daily life.",
  "E-wallet": "An e-wallet is an application that allows us to make cashless payments. One benefit is that it is fast and convenient, but users must protect their passwords from scams. For example, students can pay at the canteen without carrying much cash. I think schools can allow e-wallets if clear safety rules are provided.",
  "Vaping": "I strongly agree that vaping among those under eighteen should be banned. It can harm teenagers' health and may lead to nicotine addiction. Schools and families should educate teenagers about these risks and provide support. In conclusion, a ban can protect young people and encourage healthier choices.",
  "Stress management": "Schoolwork and examinations sometimes make me feel stressed. I reduce stress by listening to music, exercising and planning my tasks. Managing stress is important because it helps me think clearly and stay healthy. If a friend is stressed, I will listen to them and encourage them to seek help.",
  "A healthy lifestyle": "I maintain a healthy lifestyle by exercising three times a week and eating balanced meals. I choose these habits because they keep me active and help me concentrate. For example, I walk in the evening instead of spending all my time on my phone. We can encourage others by inviting them to exercise together.",
  "Food delivery apps": "I partly agree that food delivery apps have many disadvantages. They can be costly and may encourage people to order unhealthy food too often. However, they are useful for busy families or during emergencies. Therefore, we should use these apps wisely and not depend on them every day.",
  "A movie": "I recently watched an animated movie with my best friend. I enjoyed it because the story was exciting and the characters were memorable. The movie made me feel inspired to be more courageous. I believe movies can broaden our perspective by showing us different cultures, problems and experiences.",
  "Learning something new": "Recently, I learned how to cook fried rice by watching my mother and an online video. This skill is useful because I can prepare a simple meal for myself. I also learned to be patient and follow instructions carefully. Teenagers should learn new things because useful skills make us more independent.",
  "Digital literacy": "Digital literacy is becoming a fundamental skill in every job sector. Workers need it for communication, research and completing tasks efficiently. For example, even a small business uses online payments and social media. It also helps people recognise scams and stay safe online, so it is essential for future careers.",
  "Plan after SPM": "After SPM, I plan to continue my studies in college. I want to study education because I enjoy helping others learn. My family and teachers support my decision. To prepare, I will research suitable courses, improve my English and work hard to meet the entry requirements.",
  "Your neighbours": "My neighbours are a friendly family who live next door. I meet them several times a week, and they sometimes help to collect parcels when my family is away. We also share food during festivals. Good neighbours are important because they make the community safer, friendlier and more caring.",
  "Multiple skills": "Learning multiple skills helps us in many ways. It builds confidence, improves problem-solving and prepares us for different careers. For example, a student who can communicate well and use technology can handle more tasks. These skills also make us more independent and ready for future challenges."
